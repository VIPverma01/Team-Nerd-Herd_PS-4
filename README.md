# Image Recognition of FISH SPECIES AND ESTIMATION OF THEIR PROPORTION

# Idea
Automate the process of Fish Stock Assessment and overcome the limitations of manual monitoring and reporting.

In order to solve the problem, we have divided it into two parts:
* Image recognition for species made available in the database.
* Estimation of their proportion

Our Solution:
A Deep Learning Model that implements recognition of different species of fishes in a given image using Yolo v5 Object Detection Model and also outputs the count of species of fish.

# Motivation
* India has a vast area surrounded by water bodies
* Lots of people are dependent on Sea Food
* Easy Fish Stock Estimation
* India lacks the data and research regarding sea food
* Helps in estimating the diversity of fishes in a particular water body
* It has both commercial and Research Benefits

# Technologies Used
* YOLO V5 OBJECT DETECTION MODEL – For Detection and Classification of Fish Species
* HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT- For Frontend
* Flask – For Backend

# PRACTICAL USES OF THE SOLUTION
* Our model can be used in cameras installed at the harbors where species may be identified by AI and their proportion can be estimated with minimal manual intervention .
* A thorough knowledge of fish diversity, distributions, habitat requirements and life histories is essential to the management of fisheries, and conservation of species and the aquatic environment.
* The underwater imagery processing is always in high demand, especially the fish species identification. This activity is as important not only for the biologist, scientist, and fisherman, but it is also important for the education purpose
